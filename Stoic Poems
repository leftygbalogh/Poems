The Road Not Taken
By Robert Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

The Charge of the Light Brigade
By Alfred, Lord Tennyson
I
Half a league, half a league,
Half a league onward,
All in the valley of Death
 Rode the six hundred.
“Forward, the Light Brigade!
Charge for the guns!” he said.
Into the valley of Death
 Rode the six hundred.

II
“Forward, the Light Brigade!”
Was there a man dismayed?
Not though the soldier knew
 Someone had blundered.
 Theirs not to make reply,
 Theirs not to reason why,
 Theirs but to do and die.
 Into the valley of Death
 Rode the six hundred.

III
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon in front of them
 Volleyed and thundered;
Stormed at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of hell
 Rode the six hundred.

IV
Flashed all their sabres bare,
Flashed as they turned in air
Sabring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while
 All the world wondered.
Plunged in the battery-smoke
Right through the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reeled from the sabre stroke
 Shattered and sundered.
Then they rode back, but not
 Not the six hundred.

V
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon behind them
 Volleyed and thundered;
Stormed at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell.
They that had fought so well
Came through the jaws of Death,
Back from the mouth of hell,
All that was left of them,
 Left of six hundred.

VI
When can their glory fade?
O the wild charge they made!
 All the world wondered.
Honour the charge they made!
Honour the Light Brigade,
 Noble six hundred!

How Did You Die?
by
Edmund Vance Cooke


Did you tackle that trouble that came your way
With a resolute heart and cheerful?
Or hide your face from the light of day
With a craven soul and fearful?
Oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce,
Or a trouble is what you make it,
And it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,
But only how did you take it?

You are beaten to earth? Well, well, what's that?
Come up with a smiling face.
It's nothing against you to fall down flat,
But to lie there -- that's disgrace.
The harder you're thrown, why the higher you bounce;
Be proud of your blackened eye!
It isn't the fact that you're licked that counts,
It's how did you fight -- and why?

And though you be done to the death, what then?
If you battled the best you could,
If you played your part in the world of men,
Why, the Critic will call it good.
Death comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce,
And whether he's slow or spry,
It isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,
But only how did you die?



A State of Mind
by AWalter D. Wintle
If you think you are beaten, your are
If you think you dare not, you won't,
If you like to win, but don't think you can
It's almost a cinch you won't

If you think you'll lose, you're lost
For out in the world you'll find,
Success begins with a fellow's will
It's all in a state of mind

For many a game is lost
Ere even a play is run,
And many a coward fails
Ere even his work is begun

Think big and your deeds will grow
Think small and you'll fall behind
Think that you can and you will
It's all a state of mind

If you think you are out-classed, your are
You've got to think high to rise
You've got to be sure of yourself before
You can ever win a prize

Life battles don't always go
To the stronger or faster man
But sooner or later, the man who wins
Is the fellow who thinks he can

The Man Who Thinks He Can
Walter D. Wintle

If you think you are beaten, you are
If you think you dare not, you don't,
If you like to win, but you think you can't
It is almost certain you won't.
If you think you'll lose, you're lost
For out of the world we find,
Success begins with a fellow's will
It's all in the state of mind.

If you think you are outclassed, you are
You've got to think high to rise,
You've got to be sure of yourself before
You can ever win a prize.
Life's battles don't always go
To the stronger or faster man,
But soon or late the man who wins
Is the man who thinks he can.



WHEN TOMORROW STARTS WITHOUT ME
	Author: David M Romano

 When tomorrow starts without me
 And I’m not here to see
 If the sun should rise and find your eyes
 All filled with tears for me

 I wish you wouldn’t cry
 The Way you did today
 While thinking of the many things
 We did not get to say

 I know how much you love me
 As much as I love you
 Each time that you think of me
 I know you will miss me too

 When tomorrow starts with out me
 Please try to understand
 That an angel came and called my name
 And took me by the hand

 The angel said my place was ready
 In heaven far above
 And That I would have to leave behind
 All those I Dearly Love

 But When I walked through Heaven’s Gates
 I felt so much at home
 When GOD looked down and smiled at me
 From his golden throne

 He said This Is Eternity
 And All I promised you
 Today for life on earth is done
 But Here it starts a new

 I promise no tomorrow
 For today will always last
 And Since each day’s the exact same way
 There is no longing for the past

 So When Tomorrow starts without me
 Do not think we’re apart
 For every time you think of me
 Remember I’m right here in your heart

Charles Bukowski

Roll the Dice
if you’re going to try, go all the
way.
otherwise, don’t even start.

if you’re going to try, go all the
way. this could mean losing girlfriends,
wives, relatives, jobs and
maybe your mind.

go all the way.
it could mean not eating for 3 or
4 days.
it could mean freezing on a
park bench.
it could mean jail,
it could mean derision,
mockery,
isolation.
isolation is the gift,
all the others are a test of your
endurance, of
how much you really want to
do it.
and you’ll do it
despite rejection and the
worst odds
and it will be better than
anything else
you can imagine.

if you’re going to try,
go all the way.
there is no other feeling like
that.
you will be alone with the
gods
and the nights will flame with
fire.

do it, do it, do it.
do it.

all the way
all the way.
you will ride life straight to
perfect laughter,
it’s the only good fight
there is.

Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep
by
Mary Elizabeth Frye

Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there. I did not die.

If—
By Rudyard Kipling

(‘Brother Square-Toes’—Rewards and Fairies)

If you can keep your head when all about you
 Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
 But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
 Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
 And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
 If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
 And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
 Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
 And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
 And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
 And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
 To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
 Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
 Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
 If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
 With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
 And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!


 The Man In The Glass
 Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr.


 When you get what you want in your struggle for self
 And the world makes you king for a day
 Just go to the mirror and look at yourself
 And see what that man has to say.

 For it isn’t your father, or mother, or wife
 Whose judgment upon you must pass
 The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
 Is the one staring back from the glass.

 He’s the fellow to please – never mind all the rest
 For he’s with you, clear to the end
 And you’ve passed your most difficult, dangerous test
 If the man in the glass is your friend.

 You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years
 And get pats on the back as you pass
 But your final reward will be heartache and tears
 If you’ve cheated the man in the glass.


 Do not go gentle into that good night
 Dylan Thomas - 1914-1953

 Do not go gentle into that good night,
 Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
 Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

 Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
 Because their words had forked no lightning they
 Do not go gentle into that good night.

 Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
 Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
 Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

 Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
 And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
 Do not go gentle into that good night.

 Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
 Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
 Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

 And you, my father, there on the sad height,
 Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
 Do not go gentle into that good night.
 Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

 Bluebird

 there's a bluebird in my heart that
 wants to get out
 but I'm too tough for him,
 I say, stay in there, I'm not going
 to let anybody see
 you.
 there's a bluebird in my heart that
 wants to get out
 but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
 cigarette smoke
 and the whores and the bartenders
 and the grocery clerks
 never know that
 he's
 in there.

 there's a bluebird in my heart that
 wants to get out
 but I'm too tough for him,
 I say,
 stay down, do you want to mess
 me up?
 you want to screw up the
 works?
 you want to blow my book sales in
 Europe?
 there's a bluebird in my heart that
 wants to get out
 but I'm too clever, I only let him out
 at night sometimes
 when everybody's asleep.
 I say, I know that you're there,
 so don't be
 sad.
 then I put him back,
 but he's singing a little
 in there, I haven't quite let him
 die
 and we sleep together like
 that
 with our
 secret pact
 and it's nice enough to
 make a man
 weep, but I don't
 weep, do
 you?

Desiderata

GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

By Max Ehrmann © 1927

Invictus
By William Ernest Henley
Out of the night that covers me,
 Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
 For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
 I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
 My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
 Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
 Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
 How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
 I am the captain of my soul.


 If Tomorrow Starts Without Me by David Romano

 If tomorrow starts without me, and I'm not there to see,
 If the sun should rise and find your eyes all filled with tears for me;
 I wish so much you wouldn't cry the way you did today,
 while thinking of the many things we didn't get to say.
 I know how much you care for me, and how much I care for you,
 and each time that you think of me I know you'll miss me too;

 But when tomorrow starts without me, please try to understand,
 that an angel came and called my name and took me by the hand,
 and said my place was ready in heaven far above,
 and that I'd have to leave behind all those I dearly love.

 But as I turned to walk away, a tear fell from my eye,
 for all life, I'd always thought I didn't want to die.
 I had so much to live for and so much yet to do.
 it seemed almost impossible that I was leaving you.
 I thought of all the love we shared and all the fun we had.
 If I could relive yesterday, I thought, just for a while,
 I'd say goodbye and hug you and maybe see you smile.

 But then I fully realized that this could never be,
 for emptiness and memories would take the place of me.
 And when I thought of worldly things that I'd miss come tomorrow.
 I thought of you, and when I did, my heart was filled with sorrow.

 But when I walked through Heaven's gates, I felt so much at home.
 When God looked down and smiled at me, from His great golden throne,
 He said, "This is eternity and all I've promised you,
 Today your life on earth is past but here it starts anew.
 I promise no tomorrow, but today will always last.
 and since each day's the same, there's no longing for the past.

 But you have been so faithful, so trusting, so true.
 Though there were times you did some things you knew you shouldn't do.
 And you have been forgiven and now, at last, you're free.
 So won't you come and take my hand and share my life with me?"

 So if tomorrow starts without me, don't think we're far apart,
 for every time you think of me, please know I'm in your heart.

 Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep
 by
 Mary Elizabeth Frye



 Do not stand
 By my grave, and weep.
 I am not there,
 I do not sleep—
 I am the thousand winds that blow
 I am the diamond glints in snow
 I am the sunlight on ripened grain,
 I am the gentle, autumn rain.
 As you awake with morning’s hush,
 I am the swift, up-flinging rush
 Of quiet birds in circling flight,
 I am the day transcending night.
 Do not stand
 By my grave, and cry—
 I am not there,
 I did not die.

 Szabó Lőrinc: Ima a gyermekekért
 E-mail
 Fák, csillagok, állatok és kövek,
 szeressétek a gyermekeimet.

 Ha messze voltak tőlem, azalatt
 eddig is rátok bíztam sorsukat.

 Énhozzám mindig csak jók voltatok,
 szeressétek őket, ha meghalok.

 Tél, tavasz, nyár, ősz, folyók, ligetek,
 szeressétek a gyermekeimet.

 Te, homokos, köves, aszfaltos út,
 vezesd okosan a lányt, a fiút.

 Csókold helyettem, szél, az arcukat,
 fű, kő, légy párna a fejük alatt.

 Kínáld őket gyümölccsel, almafa,
 tanítsd, őket, csillagos éjszaka.

 Tanítsd, melengesd te is, drága nap,
 csempészd zsebükbe titkos aranyad.

 S ti mind, élő és halott anyagok,
 tanítsátok őket, felhők, sasok,

 vad villámok, jó hangyák, kis csigák,
 vigyázz reájuk hatalmas világ.

 Az ember gonosz, benne nem bízom.
 De tűz, víz, ég, s föld igaz rokonom.

 Igaz rokon, hozzátok fordulok,
 tűz, víz, ég s föld leszek, ha meghalok;

 tűz, víz, ég és föld s minden istenek:
 szeressétek, kiket szeretek!


 See It Through
 By Edgar Albert Guest
 When you’re up against a trouble,
 Meet it squarely, face to face;
 Lift your chin and set your shoulders,
 Plant your feet and take a brace.
 When it’s vain to try to dodge it,
 Do the best that you can do;
 You may fail, but you may conquer,
 See it through!

 Black may be the clouds about you
 And your future may seem grim,
 But don’t let your nerve desert you;
 Keep yourself in fighting trim.
 If the worst is bound to happen,
 Spite of all that you can do,
 Running from it will not save you,
 See it through!

 Even hope may seem but futile,
 When with troubles you’re beset,
 But remember you are facing
 Just what other men have met.
 You may fail, but fall still fighting;
 Don’t give up, whate’er you do;
 Eyes front, head high to the finish.
 See it through!

Good Timber

 By Douglas Malloch more Douglas Malloch

 The tree that never had to fight
      For sun and sky and air and light,
 But stood out in the open plain
      And always got its share of rain,
 Never became a forest king
      But lived and died a scrubby thing.

 The man who never had to toil
      To gain and farm his patch of soil,
 Who never had to win his share
      Of sun and sky and light and air,
 Never became a manly man
      But lived and died as he began.

 Good timber does not grow with ease,
      The stronger wind, the stronger trees,
 The further sky, the greater length,
      The more the storm, the more the strength.
 By sun and cold, by rain and snow,
      In trees and men good timbers grow.

 Where thickest lies the forest growth
      We find the patriarchs of both.
 And they hold counsel with the stars
      Whose broken branches show the scars
 Of many winds and much of strife.
      This is the common law of life.


Equipment

Edgar Guest By Edgar Guest more Edgar Guest

Figure it out for yourself, my lad,
You've all that the greatest of men have had,
Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes,
And a brain to use if you would be wise.
With this equipment they all began,
So start for the top and say "I can."

Look them over, the wise and great,
They take their food from a common plate
And similar knives and forks they use,
With similar laces they tie their shoes,
The world considers them brave and smart.
But you've all they had when they made their start.

You can triumph and come to skill,
You can be great if only you will,
You're well equipped for what fight you choose,
You have legs and arms and a brain to use,
And the man who has risen, great deeds to do
Began his life with no more than you.

You are the handicap you must face,
You are the one who must choose your place,
You must say where you want to go.
How much you will study the truth to know,
God has equipped you for life, But He
Lets you decide what you want to be.

Courage must come from the soul within,
The man must furnish the will to win,
So figure it out for yourself, my lad,
You were born with all that the great have had,
With your equipment they all began.
Get hold of yourself, and say: "I can."

The Victor

C.W. Longenecker

"If you think you are beaten, you are.
If you think you dare not, you don't.
If you like to win but think you can't,
It's almost a cinch you won't.
If you think you'll lose, you're lost.
For out in the world we find
Success begins with a fellow's will.
It's all in the state of the mind.
If you are outclassed, you are.
You've got to think high to rise.
You've got to be sure of yourself before
You can ever win the prize.
Life's battles don't always go
To the stronger or faster man.
But sooner or later, the man who wins
Is the man who thinks he can."

What Is Success
Ralph Waldo Emerson

To laugh often and much;
To win the respect of intelligent people and
the affection of children;
To earn the approbation of honest critics and endure
the betrayal of false friends;
To appreciate beauty;
To find the best in others;
To give of one's self;
To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child,
a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;
To have played and laughed with enthusiasm and
sung with exultation;
To know even one life has breathed easier because you
have lived -
This is to have succeeded.
